Goal of specialization
  know how to apply machine learning in a bunch of different context
    XRay learning
    Agricultural contexts
  will be able to put deep learning onto resume with confidence

analogy
  AI as new electricity
    affects everything in this world and transofrms the way the world works

What you will lern
1.  neural network and deep learning
  fyou will learn foundations of neural nets and deep learninghow
  how to build a neural network and and train it to recognize cats
2.  improving deep neural networks: hyperparameter tuning, regularization, optimization
  focus on practical aspwects
  diagnose price and varients
  how to tune networks
  how to train networks effectively
3. how to manke decisions as a business manager with deep learning
  when to build a neural net and when to not
  how do you deal with this challenge
  not often taught in universities
4. abbreviated convolution neural networks (CNNs)
  CNNs are often applied to images
5. learn sequence models and how to apply them to natrual language processing and other problems
  how to apply them to speech recognition and language generation
